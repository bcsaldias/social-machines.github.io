The “Foodome” addresses how we might create deeper understanding and predictive intelligence about the relationships between how we talk about food, how we learn about food and what we actually eat. Our aim is to build a food learning machine that comprehensively maps, for any given food, its form, function, production, distribution, marketing, science, policy, history and culture (as well as the connections among all of these aspects).

LSM is gathering and organizing a wide variety of data – news/social content, recipes and menus, sourcing and purchase information, etc. We then use human-machine learning to uncover patterns within and among the heterogeneous food-related data. Long term, the Foodome is meant to help improve our understanding of, access to and trust in food that is good for us; find new connections between food and health never seen before; and even predict impacts of local and global events on food.

Target is providing funding support for the Foodome as part of its Food and Future coLAB effort designed to “push the edges of science, technology and design to give people better control over their food choices and help them to eat healthier.”
