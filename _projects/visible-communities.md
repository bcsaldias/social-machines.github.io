Vast regions of the world are unmapped by comÂ­mercial services, and communities living there are digitally invisible.

Visible Communities is a system that combines what local people using smartphones see on the ground with what computers can detect from satellite images, to create an interactive map at a fine-resolution that continuously improves. The map captures both spatial and social data: houses and the paths connecting them, and the households living there and their relationships.

Enabling communities to put themselves on the map is a powerful way to increase their own visibility, and in turn serves institutional needs to improve infrastructure planning and humanitarian aid delivery. Existing approaches to do community-driven mapping either require outside experts to facilitate, or the results are lower tech and not easy to keep up to date.

In partnership with Partners in Health (PIH), and supported by the MIT Tata center, we are piloting this social machine in a sparsely populated hilly region with a Community Health Worker (CHW) network in Burera, Rwanda.

The smartphone app enables CHWs to self-map their communities. We are intentionally designing an intuitive pre-literacy touch interface enabling a wide range of users to participate without much training. By removing barriers for people at the base of the socio-economic pyramid and designing with natural social dynamics in mind, we hope to unlock existing, self-motivated human potential.
