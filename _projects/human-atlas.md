This project aims to map and analyze the publicly knowable social connections of various communities, allowing us to gain unprecedented insights about the social dynamics in such communities. Most analyses of this sort map online social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn. While these networks encode important aspects of our lives (e.g., our professional connections) they fail to capture many real-world relationships. Most of these relationships are, in fact, public and known to the community members. By mapping this publicly knowable graph, we get a unique view of the community that allows us to gain deeper understanding of its social dynamics. To this end, we built a web-based tool that is simple, easy to use, and allows the community to map itself. Our goal is to deploy this tool in communities of different sizes, including the Media Lab community and the Spanish town of Jun.
