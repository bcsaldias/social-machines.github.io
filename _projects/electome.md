The “Electome” is a comprehensive mapping of the content and network connections among the campaign’s three core public sphere voices: the Candidates, the Media, and the Public. This mapping is used to trace the election’s narratives as they form, spread, morph and decline among these three groups – identifying who and what influences these dynamics. We are developing metrics that show how responsive the Candidates and Media are to the issues that the Public find most relevant and important.

LSM’s analytics will serve as the basis of news coverage that LSM will produce in collaboration with major media partners. The ultimate aim is to offer an alternative to the “horse race journalism” that has dominated election news for the last half-century. The Electome will instead focus on surfacing the important issues at stake in the campaign, or the “The Horse Race of Ideas.”

The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation is providing support for the Electome project as part its efforts to advance excellence in journalism and increase civic engagement. For a complete list of LSM’s “Horse Race of Ideas” published articles, please click here.
