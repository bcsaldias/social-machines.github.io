To gain insights into how digital technologies can make local governments more responsive and deepen citizen engagement, we are studying the Spanish town of Jun (population 3,500). For the last four years, Jun has been using Twitter as its principal medium for citizen-government communication. We are mapping the resulting social networks and analyzing the dynamics of the Twitter interactions, in order to better understand the initiative’s impact on the town. Our long-term goal is to determine whether the system can be replicated at scale in larger communities, perhaps even major cities.
