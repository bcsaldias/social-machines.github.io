# Lab for Social Machines Jekyll Web Site

https://social-machines.github.io/

This website is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. The general flow of editing the site is:

1. Clone the repository locally:
```
git clone git@github.com:social-machines/social-machines.github.io.git
```
2. Start a Jekyll server in the cloned directory:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
This will allow you to see your local changes at http://localhost:4000 before you push them live. Every time you save a file, just refresh the page and Jekyll will have regenerated the site with the new changes.

3. Edit files locally as per the instructions below, save, and verify your changes are correct on your locally hosted version of the site.
4. Commit the changes you've made to the repository.
5. Push the changes you've made to GitHub. After a minute or two, refresh the live site to see your changes. If you do not see the changes after a few minutes, check [GitHub System Status](https://status.github.com/messages) to see if they are experiencing delays with builds.

**NOTE** Do not edit **any** files in the **_site** directory. These are auto-generated by Jekyll and will be overwritten. Pretend that folder does not exist.

## Add an image to the Life at the Lab image gallery

Say we want to add the image **tim-cook-deb.jpg** to the image gallery.

1. Add the image file to the **img/** directory.
1. Edit **life-at-the-lab.md** and add to the **images:** list **- ../img/tim-cook-deb.jpg**:

```yaml
layout: image-gallery
title: Life at the Lab
description: This page will be pretty soon.
images:
 - ../img/CASM-offsite.jpg
 - ../img/group-walk-mit.jpg
 - ../img/tim-cook.jpg
 - ../img/tim-cook-deb.jpg
```
Note that the order of the images in the **images:** list is how they will display on the site.
