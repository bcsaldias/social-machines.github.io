    The Laboratory for Social Machines (LSM) develops data science methods – based primarily on natural language processing, network science and machine learning – to map and analyze communication and interaction in human networks, and to designs tools and field experiments to investigate new forms of human networks. LSM’s core research areas of media analytics and design are being applied in three ways: (1) Analysis of large-scale media ecosystems and design of network interventions that encourage new kinds of media consumption behavior; (2) Design and experimental deployment of learning technologies that support children’s early literacy and storytelling development through small-scale networks connecting children, parents and coaches; and (3) Development of scalable listening technologies designed to surface underheard voices and create empathic bridges among communities.
